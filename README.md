<!-- Features: -->
<!-- (5 points): As a Deployer and Deployment Coordinator (admin), I want to be able 
to register/login an account with the application so that I can have a different 
application experience depending on my role. 

(2.5 points): As a Deployer and Deployment Coordinator, I want to be able to 
create a profile on the application with relevant details so that I can view those 
details at a later time. -->

(10 points): As a developer, I want to have an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive 
user interface/user experience (UI/UX) with all features of the application stylized.

(5 points): As a Deployment Coordinator, I would like to create a deployment and 
add tasks to it, indicating timeline and priority, so that I can create a checklist of 
action items for a Deployer to follow.

(2.5 points): As a Deployment Coordinator, I would like to assign Deployers to 
deployments and have the ability to view, update, and delete a Deployer from a 
deployment.

(10 points): As a Deployment Coordinator, I want to be able to view a data 
visualization timeline for each Deployer per deployment to accurately represent 
the estimated amount of time it would take to be deployment ready based on that
Deployerâ€™s current deployment status (Whether they have a visa, if they need 
more training, etc)

<!-- (5 points): As a Deployer, I want to see a dashboard that displays all of the tasks 
that need to be completed for the current day so that I can see what I should 
focus on in order to be deployment ready, in order of priority. -->

(5 points): As a Deployer/Deployment Coordinator, I would like the ability to leave 
notes next to each deployment requirement so that I can communicate updates 
on a specific deployment item. 

(5 points): As a Deployment Coordinator, I would like to pull a summary of 
deployment readiness information (percentage of deployment tasks completed) 
and filter that information by Deployer so that I can use it for meetings or 
presentations.
